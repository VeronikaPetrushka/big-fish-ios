        list: [
          {
            subtitle: "- Freshwater Fish:",
            description: `Species like carp, trout, and catfish are examples of freshwater fish, which are adapted to live in rivers, lakes, and streams. These habitats often have lower salt concentrations, which requires fish to maintain a delicate balance of electrolytes in their bodies.`,

            subtitle: "- Rivers and Streams:",
            description: `These fast-moving bodies of water are home to species like trout, salmon, and catfish. Fish that live in rivers often have streamlined bodies that help them swim efficiently against strong currents. Some species, like salmon, are anadromous, meaning they are born in freshwater, migrate to the sea, and return to rivers to spawn.`,

            subtitle: "- Lakes and Ponds:",
            description: `Lakes and ponds, with their calmer waters, support species like bass, carp, and pike. These habitats can range from shallow, warm ponds to deep, cold lakes. Fish in these environments have evolved different strategies to survive, such as living in oxygen-poor waters or finding shelter among aquatic plants.`,

          {
            subtitle: "- Deep Sea:",
            description: `The deep sea is a harsh environment with no light, immense pressure, and low temperatures. Fish that live in these regions, such as the gulper eel and the viperfish, have adapted to survive in near-total darkness. Many deep-sea fish have bioluminescent organs that they use to attract prey or communicate with one another.`,

          {
            subtitle: "- Body Shape and Movement:",
            description: `Fish in fast-moving waters often have streamlined bodies that reduce drag, while fish in calmer waters may have flattened or rounded bodies to help them maneuver through complex environments like coral reefs or aquatic plants.`,
